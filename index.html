            <p class="section-subtag text-sm"> Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="section-subtag text-sm"> Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[6]

            <p class="section-subtag text-sm"> This is ISCED level 1.[21] Primary (or elementary) education consists of
                the first four to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of
                six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five to seven, although this varies between, and
                sometimes within, countries. Globally, in 2008, around 89% of children aged six to twelve were enrolled
                in primary education, and this proportion was rising.[25][full citation needed] Under the Education For
                All programs driven by UNESCO, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in
                primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory.
